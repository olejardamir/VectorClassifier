This classifier is, in my opinion, the simplest and the most useful classifier for the NLP. 
It is simple, fast, and gives great results.
The original code was refactored from the old Classifier4j project, corrected, simplified and enhanced for the best performace.
The goal of this project is to evolve it, given the original potential, into something more useful.


Added Features:
- Sentence parser

TODO:
- POS tagger
- synonym expand for a better classification
- antonym replace for the "opposite meaning" classification
- document training/classification
- arithmetic expressions with logical operators applied onto vectors
- vector resample for comparing the different lenght of sentences
